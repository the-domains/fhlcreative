These are [words][0] that detail out the heart and spirit behind the first **_[Epicurrence][1]_**. I'd heard great things about this _non_-conference, and I was stoked to get the opportunity to participate in the first [Montues][2], set on the north side of beautiful Lake Tahoe, California.

Real conversations were what I was after, not lectures. I wanted no rockstars, just humans...Every detail mattered...The same attention I put into my designs, I was putting into this experience. --- [Dann Petty][3]
